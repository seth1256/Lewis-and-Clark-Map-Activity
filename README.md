  My mascot represents Lewis and Clark and their historic journey, by showing Lewis as the american curl(cat). Clark as the maine coon(cat). While the red (line) is their historic journey. And in the end they reached their destination (I suppose). It also shows how long their journey took to accomplish.
  
  The Lousiana Purchase changed the US by increasing LAND, (we all want that apparently). It increased the amount of trade routes the US had. We got control of the Mississippi River. The Lousiana Purchase, although screwing the US in terms of money, gave us more land, which can then be turned into farmland for crops.(huge process) The Lousiana Purchase ALSO made Thomas Jefferson change his state of mind completely, at first he wanted a strong and centeral government, then he wanted more land, (makes the government grow and get stronger in some ways). By getting more land, the US could grow their economy which then in the long run could make some money back, more land->more homes->population increase->more people for jobs->MORE MONEY->land!(NO-ONECARES)->government growth->EDUCATION.
